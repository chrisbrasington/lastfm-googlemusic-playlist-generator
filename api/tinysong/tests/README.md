Test notes
==========
Testing requires the `nose` unit testing framework. Install `nose` by running 'pip install nose`.

Before running tests, edit private_data.py and insert your personal
TinySong API key. You can grab an API key by visiting the TinySong API page 
[here](http://www.tinysong.com/api).

Finally, to run tests, execute `nosetests` from the root of the pytinysong directory. Tests are automatically
discovered.
