If you want to run tests, edit private_data.py and insert your personal
TinySong API key. You can grab an API key by visiting the TinySong API page 
[here](http://www.tinysong.com/api).

Tests can be run by using `nose`. Install nose by running `pip install nose`, then
execute `nosetests` from the root of the pytinysong directory. Tests are automatically
discovered.
